Overview
    starting with vue/cli
    Components
    Router
    Managing state
    Directives
    Filters
    Package and Deploy

Getting started with the vue cli
    Will be building Build-a-bot site

The Vue Instance
    Heart of the application 
    Created whenever you call new Vue()
        only used once in a typical vue application

    Usually tell it to render a component
    ex
        new Vue({render: h => h(App)})

    App will become the top level component in a hierarchy call Vue Structure

    wraps entire application, inside that will be app component
        App can have child component, which may have child components

    App will contain router vue which shows content for current URL
        as url changes it updates the content inside the router view

Setting up the environment
    install node
        Mac: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.0/install.sh | bash

    nvm install 8.11.2
        using same version as course

    nvm use 8.11.2

Creating a new project with the vue cli
    Vue CLI recommended when creating a project to be deployed
        vue team has designed it to allow optimization for production

Generate project
    vue create build-a-bot
        creats a new vue project in the specified directory. In this case the build-a-bot directory

    allows for choosing features and installs npm depenencies

    setup eslint

Package.json
    brought in 3 scripts for us that call the vue cli server

    vue cli service manages a local dev webserver based on webpack
        more in another course

    npm run serve
        compiles application for development
        runs server for us on port 8080

    runs sample webpage for us

Main.js
    entry point for vue application

    creates a new vue Instance
    passes in options object

    configuring render property
        set to a function that is getting App component passed to it

App.js
    3 components to file
        Template
        Script
        Style

    Vue specific wepack plugin being used to parse file into indivdual parts and compile in a way a browser can use them
    Passed into vue instance so vue works with webpack to render

    This is the top level component in our App
        used to display route components and child components

    App is displaying HelloWorld as a child component
        components>HelloWorld.vue

Creating the Home Page
    replace generated content with our own
    Get us more familiar with what CLI generated
