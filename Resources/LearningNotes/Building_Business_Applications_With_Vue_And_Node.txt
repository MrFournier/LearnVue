    MongoDB

API Layer
    Express.js will be the framework on top of Node.js where we will build our API
    Will take advantage of Express Router
    
User Experience
    Material Design
        A visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good deisgn with innovation of technology and science

    Principles
        Material is the metaphor
            Inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink.
        Bold, Graphic, Intentional
            Guided by print design methods - typeography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery - to create hierarchy, meaning, and focus the imerse viewer inthe experience.
        Motion provides meaning
            Focuses attention and maintains continuity, through subtle feedback and coherent transistions. As elements appear on screen, they transform and reorganize the environment, with interactions generating new transformations
        Flexible Foundation
            Integrated with a custom code base that allows seamless implementation of components, plug-ins, and design elements
        Cross-platform
            Maintains the same UI across platforms

Vuetify
    Provides large library of good looking components that follow the Material Deisgn principles

    Has template and script code available for components
        including forms

    Documentation
        https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start

Other Libraries
    Vue-CLI
    Eslint
    Webpack

    Axios
        Promise based HTTP Client
        communicates with Restful API client

Package.json
    shows name and descripiton of project

    depenedencies
    dev depenedencies





Module 5 Designing the Data Layer with MongoDB and Mongoose
    Code first or data first?
        Questions
        Is more known about how we want the user to interact ewith the application. Data concerns are secondary or supportive in nature?
        or 
        Do we have a better understanding of the business data requirements. Design is secondary or is not as critical to success?

    This course will use a Data first approach

Setting up MongoDB
    Install MongoDB
    Studio 3T
    Insert Sample Data
        Users for Development
        Sample transactions

Install MongoDB
    docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

    following mac os instructions
        use homebrew

        brew tap mongodb/brew

        brew install mongodb-community@4.2

        brew link --overwrite mongodb-community
            overwrote existing mongodb files

    Run MongoDB as a Mac OS service
        brew services start mongodb-community

    Verify MongoDB is running
        ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod

Creating new DB
    called globomantics (after fake client)

Adding new collections
    Users
        auto index id turned on
    transactions
        auto index id turned on

    Import data JSON files
        right click import
        select json
        pick both json files

Mongoose: The Bridge to MongoDB
    Mongoose
        object document mapper

    Everything in Mongoose starts with a schema

    schema
    ex
        const mongoose = require('mongoose')
        // Schema will mirror the mongodb document we are getting data back from
        const Schema = mongoose.Schema

        let userSchema = new Schema({
            email:      String,
            name:       String,
            password:   String, // This will want to be encrypted later on
            createdOn:  Date,
            lastLogin:  Date,
            isActive:   Boolean
        })

    Mongoose Schema Type : JavaScript Data Type
        String                  String
        Number                  Number
        Date                    Object
        Buffer                  Object
        Boolean                 Boolean
        Mixed                   Object 
        ObjectId                Object
        Array                   Array(Object)

    Mixed
        allows freedom to store whatever you want
        allows variety of data types within the same field
            must write code to deal with this data
    
Develop the Mongoose Schemas
    npm init -f
        initialize the server project
        - f signals to use default options

    npm install nodemon -g
        watcher to restart server when changes are made

    yarn add eslint
        installs a linter to enforce coding practices

    node ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js --init
        run script to initialize and create the eslint.rc files

    yarn add mongoose
        installs mongoose

    created both mongoose Schemas
        User
        Transaction

Next Steps
    What we did
        MongoDB Setup
        Mongoose Schemas created
    Time to work on the API side of things





Module 6 Developing the API with Node and Express

TransactionsSchema
    userId
        this field can be thought of as a FK relationship

Design the API
    HTTP Verbs
        HTTP Verb           CRUD Action
            POST                Create
            GET                 Read
            PUT                 Update/Replace
            PATCH               Update/Modify
            DELETE              Delete

    Put
        completely replaces the record
    Patch 
        modifies exisiting record/document
        probably won't need this

    User Endpoint
        POST, GET, Put

    Transaction Endpoint
        Post, Get, Put, Delete

API Folder
    routes go under here
        'endpoints'

    Server
        api
            routes
                transactions.js 
                user.js
            index.js 
        models 
            transactions.js
            user.js

    index.js in the api folder is used to conveintienly bundle all of the other route files

    routes will reference a specific model

    user route ex
        const User = require('../../models/user')

        module.exports = function (router) {
            router.get('/user/:id', function (req, res) {
                User.findById(req.params.id).exec()
                    .then(docs => res.status(200)
                        .json(docs))
            })
        }

    1) require the User model file (mongoose schema)
    2) pass a reference to the express router
    3) make get call, via mongoose find by id function
        on success return a json file and 200 status
    
Demo

Install Express
    yarn add express
        this installs express js    

app.js
    in server root
    Main kickoff point for express server

    const api = require('./api')
        picks up all the routes bundled in the index file for us

Helpfully NPM packages
    yarn add morgan
    yarn add body-parser

    morgan
        logs requests to our api
    
    body-parser
        parses request bodies

    app.set('port', (process.env.PORT || 8081))
        tell express application what port to listen on
        defaults to 8081 if no PORT node environment var

    app.use(express.static('static'))
        give express access to static files in the project
        common practice

    app.use(function (req, res, next) {
        const err = new Error('Not Found')
        err.status = 404
        res.json(err)
    })
    handles requests to unknown resources

    db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'))
        testing for errors and console logging if they are there
    
    db.once('open', function () {
        console.log('Connected to MongoDB')

        app.listen(app.get('port'), function () {
            console.log('API Server Listening on port ' + app.get('port') + '!')
        })
    })
    Once db connection open callback function gets app to start listening on our port

API Routes
    .exec()
        returns a promise

    module.exports = function (router) {
        router.get('/user/:id', function (req, res) {
            User.findById(req.params.id).exec()
            .then(docs => res.status(200)
                .json(docs))
            .catch(err => res.status(500)
                .json({
                    message: 'Error finding user',
                    error: err
                }))
        })
    }
    One end point to retrieve users from the db via id
    returns doc as json on success
    return json error with 500 status on fail

    router.put('/user/:id', function (req, res) {
        console.log(req.body)
        let qry = { _id: req.params.id }
        let doc = {
            // first: req.body.firstname,
            // last: req.body.lastname,
            // email: req.body.email,
            // password: req.body.password,
            isActive: req.body.isActive
        }
        console.log(doc)
        User.update(qry, doc, function (err, respRaw) {
            if (err) return console.log(err)
            res.status(200).json(respRaw)
        })
    })
    let doc
        note this is creating a new document and mapping values
            useful for if you only want certain values to be updateable

    const pipeline = [
      {
        $match: {
          userId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId(userId),
        }
      },
      {
        $match: {
          transactionDate: { $lt: endDt }
        }
      },
      {
        $group: {
          _id: null,
          charges: { $sum: '$charge' },
          deposits: { $sum: '$deposit' }
        }
      }
    ]
    pipeline
        $group defines the values we want back
        this is passed as a parameter into the mongoose aggregate function

Debugging and Testing the API
    used postman to check data from end points

Next Steps
    Done
        API services
        Test with postman
            works
    Next
        Vue.js client project "stub"
