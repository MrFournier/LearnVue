Building Business Applications with Vue.js and MongoDB

Module 2
Introduces you to the Venom stack

Venom stack
    Vue.js
    Express.js
    Node.js
    Mongoose for MongoDB

Application Design Meeting
    Course develops a mvp from fictious client meetings




Module 3 Technology Stack
Architectural Approach
    - UI Layer
    - Restful API
    - Data Access
    - Separation of Concerns

Client (UI)
    Routes
    Components
    State

Server (API)
    API Routes
    Models

Core Frameworks
    Vue.js
    Express.js
    Node.js
        reccomended previous knowledge of Node

Data Access Layer
    Mongoose
    MongoDB

API Layer
    Express.js will be the framework on top of Node.js where we will build our API
    Will take advantage of Express Router
    
User Experience
    Material Design
        A visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good deisgn with innovation of technology and science

    Principles
        Material is the metaphor
            Inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink.
        Bold, Graphic, Intentional
            Guided by print design methods - typeography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery - to create hierarchy, meaning, and focus the imerse viewer inthe experience.
        Motion provides meaning
            Focuses attention and maintains continuity, through subtle feedback and coherent transistions. As elements appear on screen, they transform and reorganize the environment, with interactions generating new transformations
        Flexible Foundation
            Integrated with a custom code base that allows seamless implementation of components, plug-ins, and design elements
        Cross-platform
            Maintains the same UI across platforms

Vuetify
    Provides large library of good looking components that follow the Material Deisgn principles

    Has template and script code available for components
        including forms

    Documentation
        https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start

Other Libraries
    Vue-CLI
    Eslint
    Webpack

    Axios
        Promise based HTTP Client
        communicates with Restful API client

    bodyparser
        used to parse incoming request body
    
    Morgan
        request logger

    nodemon
    cors
    bcrypt.js
    
Development Tools
    VS Code
    Postman
        getpostman.com
    Studio 3T




Module 4 Setting Up the Demo Application

Setting up our project
    install node
    install yarn
        yarnpkg.com
        brew install yarn

repos/LearnVue/Venom
    vue init webpack client

    To get started:
        cd client
        npm run dev

Baseline Architecture
Folder Structure
    we will mimic two servers using folders for this Demo

Client
    Houses Vue.js interface project code

Server
    API end points and mongoose Models

Package.json
    shows name and descripiton of project

    depenedencies
    dev depenedencies
